Replit AI Prompt — Continue tasks + Fix registration form (Django + PostgreSQL)

Continue working on this Django project and complete all the tasks below.
Make sure all solutions follow Django best practices and that the project uses PostgreSQL as its database.

✅ Additional required task: Fix the User Registration Form

You must fix the entire registration page because:

The form is not saving data into the PostgreSQL database.

The “Cadastrar” (Register) button is reloading the same page, instead of redirecting to the login page.

Fix requirements:

Ensure the Django view handles POST requests correctly.

Validate all inputs.

Save the user into the PostgreSQL database using the correct Django model.

After successful registration, redirect to the login page.

If needed, fix the form, model, view, template, or URL.

Create missing files if required.
